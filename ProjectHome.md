Slide show Exporter is an iPhoto'08 plugin for creating simple, self-contained slide shows from iPhoto albums or selected images. It is intended for making CDs or web pages.

Unlike the iPhoto Web Album exporter, the slide shows created by Slide show Exporter consist of only the images, thumbnails, and two additional files all written to the specified destination folder. For _N_ images, the exporter writes the images to images/1.jpg, ..., images/_N_.png, the thumbnails to thumbnails/1.png, ..., thumbnails/_N_.png, the image list to images.js, and the index page to index.html.

See http://drhanson.net/demos/sailing/ for an example of the outputs created by the Slideshow Exporter.
