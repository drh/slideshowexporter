In iPhoto, do the following steps.

  1. Select the album or images you want to export and select File|Exportâ€¦
  1. Click Slideshow and select the image size and quality for the exported images.
  1. Click Export and select the destination folder, creating it if necessary.

To view the slide show, double click index.html in the destination folder.
Click on a thumbnail to view that image.
The slide show displays images at the Medium size (640 pixels maximum dimension)
so they fit on the page, but the images are exported at whatever size you select.
So, for example, you can export Full Size images and view them in the slide show
at a more reasonable size.
The scaling is done by the browser, so viewing Full Size images is slower.
Thumbnails are always exported at 100 pixels maximum dimension and at Low quality.
